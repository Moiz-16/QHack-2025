# Quantum Bank Heist: QAOA Path Optimisation (QHack 2025)

## Executive Summary
This project implements a quantum approach to solving the "Escaping the Police Chase" challenge (challenge 2) presented in the QHack 2025 hackathon organized by the University of Bristol Quantum Computing Society. The simulation leverages the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to identify optimal getaway routes for criminals attempting to reach a safehouse after a bank heist while evading law enforcement.

## 1. Problem Domain and Formulation

### 1.1 The Quantum Bank Heist Scenario
In our simulation, criminals have successfully executed a bank robbery and must now escape to a safehouse through a city monitored by police. This high-stakes scenario presents a perfect opportunity to apply quantum computing for route optimization under constraints:

- **Multiple Potential Routes**: The city offers numerous paths between locations
- **Variable Risk Levels**: Different routes have different risk profiles (police presence, cameras, traffic)
- **Time Pressure**: Optimal decisions must be made quickly to evade capture
- **Limited Information**: Not all police positions may be known in advance

### 1.2 Mathematical Representation
The escape scenario is formalized as a graph-based optimization problem:

- **City Graph**: G = (V, E) where V represents locations and E represents routes
- **Weighted Edges**: Each edge e ∈ E has a weight w(e) representing difficulty/risk
- **Source and Target**: Two special vertices, s, t ∈ V represent the bank and safehouse
- **Objective Function**: Minimize the total risk along a valid path from s to t

### 1.3 Quantum Relevance
This problem is well-suited for quantum computing approaches because:

1. The solution space grows exponentially with graph size (2^|E| possible route combinations)
2. Quantum superposition allows simultaneous exploration of multiple escape routes
3. The problem maps naturally to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation
4. Quantum algorithms like QAOA can potentially find high-quality solutions faster than classical approaches for sufficiently complex instances

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 City Graph Generation and Properties

The city environment is modeled as a directed graph with specific properties to ensure realism:

```python
def generate_city_graph(num_nodes=10, max_edges=18, min_weight=1, max_weight=10):
    """Generate a random directed graph representing a city with varying difficulties of travel"""
    G = nx.DiGraph()

    # Add nodes
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        G.add_node(i)

    # First create a path through all nodes to ensure connectivity
    for i in range(num_nodes - 1):
        # The weight represents difficulty (police presence, traffic, cameras, etc.)
        weight = random.uniform(min_weight, max_weight)
        G.add_edge(i, i + 1, weight=weight)

    # Add remaining random edges (staying under max_edges)
    remaining_edges = max_edges - (num_nodes - 1)
    edge_count = num_nodes - 1

    # Try to add random edges, up to the limit
    attempts = 0
    while edge_count < max_edges and attempts < 100:
        i = random.randint(0, num_nodes - 1)
        j = random.randint(0, num_nodes - 1)
        if i != j and not G.has_edge(i, j):
            weight = random.uniform(min_weight, max_weight)
            G.add_edge(i, j, weight=weight)
            edge_count += 1
        attempts += 1

    print(f"Created city graph with {G.number_of_nodes()} locations and {G.number_of_edges()} routes")
    return G
```

Key features of the graph generation include:
- **Guaranteed Connectivity**: A path through all nodes ensures there's always at least one possible escape route
- **Variable Edge Density**: The number of routes can be configured to simulate different city layouts
- **Weighted Routes**: Edge weights vary randomly to represent different levels of difficulty/risk
- **Directional Movement**: Directed edges represent one-way streets or routes with directional constraints

### 2.2 Bank and Safehouse Designation

The algorithm strategically selects bank and safehouse locations to ensure an interesting challenge:

```python
def designate_bank_and_safehouse(graph, min_distance=3):
    """Designate which nodes represent the bank and the safehouse"""
    nodes = list(graph.nodes())
    if len(nodes) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Graph must have at least 2 nodes")

    # Make sure we only try valid pairs of nodes
    attempts = 0
    max_attempts = 100

    while attempts < max_attempts:
        bank = random.choice(nodes)
        safehouse = random.choice(nodes)

        # Ensure bank and safehouse are different
        if bank == safehouse:
            attempts += 1
            continue

        # Check if there's a path between them
        if not nx.has_path(graph, bank, safehouse):
            attempts += 1
            continue

        # Check minimum distance to make it interesting
        path = nx.shortest_path(graph, bank, safehouse)
        if len(path) >= min_distance:
            print(f"Bank is at location {bank}, safehouse is at location {safehouse}")
            return bank, safehouse

        attempts += 1
```

Critical design choices include:
- **Minimum Distance Requirement**: Ensures the problem is non-trivial by mandating a minimum path length
- **Path Existence Verification**: Confirms that at least one valid path exists between bank and safehouse
- **Randomized Selection**: Bank and safehouse locations vary between simulation runs, adding variety

### 2.3 Theoretical Foundations of QAOA

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA belongs to the broader class of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that leverage the power of quantum computers for specific optimization tasks while using classical computers for parameter optimization.

#### 2.3.1 QAOA Mathematical Framework

At its core, QAOA attempts to prepare a quantum state that encodes the solution to an optimization problem. For a problem with a cost function C(z) to be minimized over n-bit strings z, QAOA proceeds as follows:

1. **Initial State Preparation**: Start with an equal superposition of all possible states:
   ```
   |ψ₀⟩ = (1/√2ⁿ) ∑ |z⟩
   ```
   where the sum is over all z in {0,1}ⁿ

2. **Alternating Operator Evolution**: Apply p layers of alternating operators:
   ```
   |ψₚ(β⃗,γ⃗)⟩ = e^(-iβₚHₘ) e^(-iγₚHₖ) ... e^(-iβ₁Hₘ) e^(-iγ₁Hₖ) |ψ₀⟩
   ```
   Where:
   - Hₖ = ∑ C(z)|z⟩⟨z| is the cost Hamiltonian
   - Hₘ = ∑ Xⱼ is the mixing Hamiltonian (with Xⱼ being the Pauli-X operator on qubit j)
   - β⃗ and γ⃗ are the variational parameters to be optimized

3. **Expectation Value Calculation**: Compute the expected value of the cost function:
   ```
   F₍(β⃗,γ⃗) = ⟨ψₚ(β⃗,γ⃗)|Hₖ|ψₚ(β⃗,γ⃗)⟩
   ```

4. **Classical Optimization**: Use classical optimization techniques to find optimal parameters:
   ```
   (β⃗*,γ⃗*) = argmin F₍(β⃗,γ⃗)
   ```

5. **Solution Sampling**: Measure the final state |ψₚ(β⃗*,γ⃗*)⟩ to obtain bit strings that represent high-quality solutions to the original problem.

The algorithm's effectiveness improves with the number of layers p, with p→∞ theoretically converging to the global optimum. However, even small values of p can provide good approximate solutions for many problems.

#### 2.3.2 QAOA for Shortest Path Problems

For the shortest path problem specifically, QAOA requires several adaptations:

1. **Problem Encoding**: Each edge in the graph is represented by a qubit, where a value of 1 indicates the edge is part of the solution path.

2. **Cost Function**: The sum of weights for selected edges, which should be minimized.

3. **Constraint Enforcement**: Path validity constraints must be incorporated into the cost function or added as penalty terms.

4. **State Measurement**: The final state must be interpreted as a valid path through the graph.

The primary challenge is that the shortest path problem requires enforcing connectivity constraints to ensure a valid path, which often leads to complex penalty terms in the QUBO formulation.

### 2.4 QUBO Problem Formulation for Getaway Path Optimization

To apply QAOA to our getaway path problem, we first need to formulate the shortest path problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. This transformation is crucial as it allows us to express the problem in a form suitable for quantum processing.

The shortest path problem in our bank heist context involves finding the path from bank to safehouse that minimizes total risk (represented by edge weights). Our QUBO formulation consists of:

```python
# Create QuadraticProgram for shortest path
qp = QuadraticProgram()

# Add binary variables for each edge
edge_vars = {}
for i, (u, v, data) in enumerate(graph.edges(data=True)):
    var_name = f'x_{u}_{v}'
    edge_vars[(u, v)] = var_name
    qp.binary_var(var_name)

# Objective: minimize path difficulty (weight)
linear = {}
for (u, v), var_name in edge_vars.items():
    linear[var_name] = graph[u][v]['weight']

qp.minimize(linear=linear)

# Add flow constraints
for node in graph.nodes():
    incoming = [edge_vars.get((u, node)) for u in graph.predecessors(node) 
                if (u, node) in edge_vars]
    outgoing = [edge_vars.get((node, v)) for v in graph.successors(node) 
                if (node, v) in edge_vars]

    # Skip if no connections
    if not incoming and not outgoing:
        continue

    # Flow constraint dictionary
    flow_dict = {}

    if node == start_node:
        # Start node: outflow - inflow = 1
        for var in outgoing:
            flow_dict[var] = 1
        for var in incoming:
            flow_dict[var] = -1
        qp.linear_constraint(linear=flow_dict, sense='==', rhs=1)

    elif node == end_node:
        # End node: inflow - outflow = 1
        for var in incoming:
            flow_dict[var] = 1
        for var in outgoing:
            flow_dict[var] = -1
        qp.linear_constraint(linear=flow_dict, sense='==', rhs=1)

    else:
        # Transit nodes: inflow = outflow
        for var in incoming:
            flow_dict[var] = 1
        for var in outgoing:
            flow_dict[var] = -1
        qp.linear_constraint(linear=flow_dict, sense='==', rhs=0)
```

Key elements of the QUBO formulation:
- **Binary Decision Variables**: Each edge has a binary variable indicating whether it's part of the escape route
- **Linear Objective Function**: Minimizes the sum of weights for selected edges
- **Flow Conservation Constraints**: 
  - Source node (bank) has net outflow of 1
  - Target node (safehouse) has net inflow of 1 
  - All transit nodes maintain equal inflow and outflow
- **Constraint Conversion**: The constraints are integrated into the objective function via the QUBO conversion process

### 2.5 QAOA Circuit Implementation

Our implementation leverages Qiskit's QAOAAnsatz to create and optimize a parameterized quantum circuit. While the theoretical foundations of QAOA are elegant, real-world implementation requires careful consideration of various practical aspects:

```python
# Get the Ising Hamiltonian
ising, offset = qubo.to_ising()

# Create QAOA circuit using QAOAAnsatz
qaoa_ansatz = QAOAAnsatz(cost_operator=ising, reps=qaoa_reps)

# Set up simulator with unlimited qubits and higher optimization level
simulator = AerSimulator(method='statevector')

# Create function to evaluate the QAOA cost for a given set of parameters
def objective_function(parameters):
    # Assign parameters to the circuit
    parameter_dict = dict(zip(qaoa_ansatz.parameters, parameters))
    qaoa_with_parameters = qaoa_ansatz.assign_parameters(parameter_dict)

    # Add measurement to all qubits
    qaoa_circuit = qaoa_with_parameters.copy()
    qaoa_circuit.measure_all()

    # Transpile with optimization
    compiled_circuit = transpile(qaoa_circuit, simulator, optimization_level=3)

    # Run on simulator
    job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=1024)
    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts()

    # Calculate expected energy for each measured state
    energy = 0
    for bitstring, count in counts.items():
        # Convert bitstring to a dictionary of qubit values
        qubit_values = {}
        variable_names = list(edge_vars.values())
        variable_names.sort()  # Ensure consistent ordering

        for i, var_name in enumerate(variable_names):
            # Map from bitstring positions to variable values
            bit_pos = len(bitstring) - 1 - i
            if bit_pos >= 0 and bit_pos < len(bitstring):
                qubit_values[var_name] = int(bitstring[bit_pos])
            else:
                qubit_values[var_name] = 0  # Default if out of range

        # Calculate the cost of this solution
        solution_cost = sum(graph[u][v]['weight'] * qubit_values[var_name]
                            for (u, v), var_name in edge_vars.items()
                            if var_name in qubit_values)

        # Weight by the probability of this outcome
        probability = count / 1024
        energy += solution_cost * probability

    return energy
```

Advanced implementation features:
- **Reps Parameter**: Multiple QAOA layers (reps=3) for improved solution quality
- **Parameter Initialization Strategy**: Carefully chosen initial parameters based on problem characteristics
- **Optimization Level**: High transpilation optimization (level 3) for efficient circuit execution
- **Statistical Sampling**: 1024 shots to obtain reliable probability distributions
- **Energy Calculation**: Weighted average of solution costs based on measurement probabilities

### 2.5 Classical Optimization of QAOA Parameters

The QAOA circuit parameters are optimized using classical methods:

```python
# Better initial parameters for QAOA
initial_betas = np.linspace(0.01, np.pi / 2, qaoa_reps)  # Gradually increasing beta values
initial_gammas = np.linspace(0.01, np.pi, qaoa_reps)  # Gradually increasing gamma values
initial_params = np.concatenate([initial_betas, initial_gammas])

# Number of optimization iterations
max_iter = 50  # Adjust based on your needs

print(f"Optimizing getaway route parameters with {max_iter} iterations...")

# Run optimization - COBYLA is often good for noisy functions like quantum circuits
result = minimize(
    objective_function,
    initial_params,
    method='COBYLA',
    options={'maxiter': max_iter, 'disp': True}
)
```

Key optimization features:
- **Thoughtful Initial Parameters**: Strategic initialization with gradually increasing values
- **COBYLA Optimizer**: Well-suited for noisy, non-differentiable objective functions
- **Iteration Control**: Configurable maximum iterations to balance solution quality and runtime
- **Progress Feedback**: Optimization progress is tracked and displayed

### 2.6 Solution Extraction and Validation

Once the optimal parameters are found, the solution is extracted and validated:

```python
# Use the optimized parameters for the final circuit
parameter_dict = dict(zip(qaoa_ansatz.parameters, optimized_params))
final_qaoa = qaoa_ansatz.assign_parameters(parameter_dict)
final_qaoa.measure_all()

# Run final circuit with optimized parameters
compiled_circuit = transpile(final_qaoa, simulator, optimization_level=3)
job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=2048)  # More shots for final run
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()

# Get the most frequent bitstring
most_frequent = max(counts, key=counts.get)
print(f"Most frequent measurement: {most_frequent} (frequency: {counts[most_frequent] / 2048:.2%})")

# Create mapping from bit positions to variable names
variable_names = list(edge_vars.values())
variable_names.sort()  # Ensure consistent ordering

# Map result back to edge selection
selected_edges = []
for (u, v), var_name in edge_vars.items():
    # Find the position of this variable in the list
    var_idx = variable_names.index(var_name)
    # Check if this edge is selected in the solution
    bit_pos = len(most_frequent) - 1 - var_idx
    if bit_pos >= 0 and bit_pos < len(most_frequent) and most_frequent[bit_pos] == '1':
        selected_edges.append((u, v))
        print(f"Selected route: {u} -> {v}")
```

Solution processing includes:
- **Increased Statistical Power**: 2048 shots for more accurate final results
- **Most Frequent Selection**: Selection of the most probable measurement outcome
- **Bitstring Mapping**: Conversion from quantum measurement to edge selection decisions
- **Solution Validation**: Verification that selected edges form a valid path

### 2.7 Solution Repair Mechanism

A sophisticated repair mechanism handles cases where the quantum solution is incomplete or invalid:

```python
def repair_invalid_solution(graph, selected_edges, start_node, end_node):
    """Attempt to repair an invalid solution by adding necessary edges"""
    print("Attempting to repair invalid getaway route...")

    # Create a graph from selected edges
    path_graph = nx.DiGraph()
    path_graph.add_edges_from(selected_edges)

    # Make sure start and end nodes are in the graph
    for node in [start_node, end_node]:
        if node not in path_graph:
            path_graph.add_node(node)
            print(f"Added missing node {node} to path graph")

    # If there's no path from start to end, we need to add edges
    if not nx.has_path(path_graph, start_node, end_node):
        # Find all nodes reachable from start
        try:
            reachable_from_start = set(nx.descendants(path_graph, start_node))
            reachable_from_start.add(start_node)
        except nx.NetworkXError:
            reachable_from_start = {start_node}  # Just the start node if it's isolated

        # Find all nodes that can reach end
        try:
            # If end_node has no incoming edges, this might fail
            can_reach_end = set()
            reversed_graph = path_graph.reverse()
            if end_node in reversed_graph:
                can_reach_end = set(nx.descendants(reversed_graph, end_node))
            can_reach_end.add(end_node)
        except nx.NetworkXError:
            can_reach_end = {end_node}  # Just the end node if it's isolated

        # Find connecting edges from the original graph
        connecting_edges = []
        for u in reachable_from_start:
            for v in can_reach_end:
                if u != v and graph.has_edge(u, v) and not path_graph.has_edge(u, v):
                    connecting_edges.append((u, v, graph[u][v]['weight']))

        # Sort by weight and add the lightest connecting edge
        if connecting_edges:
            connecting_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
            u, v, _ = connecting_edges[0]
            path_graph.add_edge(u, v, weight=graph[u][v]['weight'])
            selected_edges.append((u, v))
            print(f"Added connecting route: {u} -> {v}")
        else:
            # Additional fallback mechanisms...
```

The repair strategy includes:
- **Reachability Analysis**: Identifies nodes reachable from the bank and nodes that can reach the safehouse
- **Minimal Connection Strategy**: Adds the lowest-weight edge that connects these two sets
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple layers of repair strategies with decreasing complexity
- **Classical Fallback**: Defaults to classical shortest path if repair fails

### 2.8 Visualization and Analysis

The solution is visualized to provide clear insights into the escape route:

```python
def visualize_heist_scenario(graph, bank_node, safehouse_node, qaoa_path=None, selected_edges=None,
                             classical_path=None):
    """Visualize the city with bank, safehouse, and getaway paths"""
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 12))

    # Use spring layout for city layout with a fixed seed for reproducibility
    pos = nx.spring_layout(graph, seed=42)

    # Draw all locations and routes
    nx.draw_networkx_nodes(graph, pos, node_color='lightgray', node_size=300, ax=ax)
    nx.draw_networkx_labels(graph, pos, ax=ax)
    nx.draw_networkx_edges(graph, pos, alpha=0.2, ax=ax)

    # Draw edge labels (difficulty values)
    edge_labels = {(u, v): f"{d['weight']:.1f}" for u, v, d in graph.edges(data=True)}
    nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(graph, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels, font_size=8, ax=ax)

    # Highlight bank and safehouse
    nx.draw_networkx_nodes(graph, pos, nodelist=[bank_node],
                           node_color='red', node_size=500, ax=ax)
    nx.draw_networkx_nodes(graph, pos, nodelist=[safehouse_node],
                           node_color='green', node_size=500, ax=ax)

    # Additional visualization elements for paths and legend...
```

Visualization features include:
- **Color-Coded Elements**: Different colors for bank, safehouse, and routes
- **Weight Labeling**: Clear display of route difficulty values
- **Path Highlighting**: Distinct visualization of quantum and classical paths
- **Informative Legend**: Clear explanation of all visual elements
- **Comparison View**: Side-by-side comparison of quantum and classical solutions

## 3. Solution Analysis and Evaluation

### 3.1 Experimental Results

To evaluate the performance of our QAOA implementation for the bank heist scenario, we conducted extensive experiments with multiple simulation runs. The results provide valuable insights into the algorithm's effectiveness, reliability, and computational efficiency.

#### 3.1.1 Simulation Overview

We performed two sets of experiments:
- Initial test: 20 simulation runs with varied city graph configurations
- Extended evaluation: 50 simulation runs with the same parameters

Each simulation generated a random city graph with various configurations of nodes (locations), edges (routes), and weights (risk factors). The QAOA algorithm was tasked with finding the optimal getaway path from bank to safehouse, with results compared against classical shortest path algorithms.

#### 3.1.2 QAOA Performance Metrics

The simulations tracked several key performance metrics:

| Metric | 20-Run Results | 50-Run Results |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Success rate | 100.00% | 100.00% |
| Required classical fallback | 55.00% | 60.00% |
| Required repair mechanism | 30.00% | 32.00% |
| Path matched classical solution | 80.00% | 88.00% |
| Average approximation ratio | 0.9376 | 0.9493 |
| Median approximation ratio | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| Median speedup factor | 2,482,622.63 | 2,792,238.45 |

These results reveal several important patterns:

1. **Solution Quality**: The QAOA algorithm consistently produced high-quality solutions, with average approximation ratios of ~0.94 compared to classical solutions. The median approximation ratio of 1.0 indicates that in most cases, QAOA found the optimal solution.

2. **Reliability Challenges**: While the overall success rate was 100%, this includes runs where fallback mechanisms were activated. Pure QAOA success (without requiring repair or fallback) occurred in only 15% of the 20-run test and 8% of the 50-run test.

3. **Solution Repair Effectiveness**: The repair mechanism successfully recovered valid solutions in approximately 30-32% of runs, demonstrating the importance of post-processing for quantum solutions.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: The classical algorithm was significantly faster than the simulated QAOA implementation, as indicated by the large speedup factor. This is expected for simulated quantum computing on classical hardware.

#### 3.1.3 Visual Analysis of Results

The experimental results were visualized through several key diagrams:

1. **QAOA Performance by Graph Size**:
   The stacked bar charts show the distribution of clean successes, classical fallbacks, and repairs required for 10-node graphs. The consistency between the 20-run and 50-run experiments demonstrates the reliability of our findings.

2. **Approximation Ratio Analysis**:
   These charts compare the QAOA approximation ratio to the optimal (1.0) value. The high average ratio of ~0.95 indicates that even when QAOA doesn't find the exact optimal solution, it comes very close.

3. **Getaway Route Visualizations**:
   These network diagrams show various bank heist scenarios with different bank and safehouse locations. The paths highlighted represent the optimal getaway routes identified by the algorithm. Notable observations include:
   - Image 1: A three-node path (3→8→7) that follows edges with lower weights
   - Image 2: A two-node direct path (8→0→4) representing a simple escape route
   - Image 3: A path utilizing intermediate locations to avoid high-risk areas
   - Image 4: A scenario showing repaired QAOA routes (orange) alongside the optimal path (purple)
   - Image 5: A more complex route with multiple intermediate stops (2→9→6→7→8)

4. **QAOA Success Rate Breakdown**:
   The pie charts illustrate the proportion of different outcome types. Most notable is the high reliance on classical fallback (55-60%), indicating opportunities for quantum algorithm improvement.

5. **Execution Time Comparison**:
   These box plots show the dramatic difference in execution time between QAOA and classical algorithms. The logarithmic scale highlights that classical algorithms are several orders of magnitude faster in the current implementation.

### 3.2 Analysis of QAOA Challenges and Successes

The experimental results highlight several important aspects of QAOA's performance:

#### Success Patterns
- **Optimal Solutions**: In 88% of cases (in the 50-run experiment), QAOA solutions matched the classical optimal path, either directly or through fallback mechanisms.
- **Near-Optimal Approximations**: Even when not finding the exact optimal solution, QAOA consistently produced high-quality approximations with a ratio of ~0.95.
- **Solution Integrity**: The implementation always produced a valid path from bank to safehouse, thanks to the robust repair and fallback mechanisms.

#### Challenge Patterns
- **Pure QAOA Reliability**: Only 8-15% of runs succeeded without requiring any repair or fallback, indicating challenges in the direct QAOA solution process.
- **High Fallback Rate**: The algorithm relied on classical fallback in 55-60% of cases, suggesting opportunities for improved quantum parameter optimization.
- **Computational Efficiency**: The large speedup factor (classical being faster) is expected for simulated quantum computing but indicates that significant quantum advantage would require actual quantum hardware or larger problem instances.

#### Visual Insights
The network visualizations provide valuable qualitative insights:
- The algorithm successfully identified paths that intelligently balance total distance with risk factors (edge weights).
- Different bank and safehouse configurations resulted in varied path complexities, demonstrating the algorithm's adaptability.
- The repair mechanism (visible in Image 8 with orange edges) effectively connected disconnected path segments to form valid solutions.

### 3.3 Performance Analysis and Limitations

Our experimental results reveal several important aspects of the QAOA implementation:

#### 3.5.1 Consistency Between Sample Sizes

Comparing the 20-run and 50-run experiments reveals remarkably consistent patterns:

| Metric | Change from 20 to 50 Runs |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Required classical fallback | +5% (55% → 60%) |
| Required repair mechanism | +2% (30% → 32%) |
| Path matched classical solution | +8% (80% → 88%) |
| Average approximation ratio | +0.0117 (0.9376 → 0.9493) |
| Median approximation ratio | No change (1.0000) |
| Median speedup factor | +309,615.81 |

The small variations between the two sample sizes suggest that our experiment achieved sufficient statistical power even at 20 runs. The 50-run experiment primarily served to confirm the findings with higher confidence and reveal subtle patterns that might not be visible in smaller samples.

#### 3.5.2 Key Trends and Observations

Several significant trends emerge from the expanded analysis:

1. **Increasing Fallback Reliance**: The slight increase in classical fallback rate (55% → 60%) might indicate that larger sample sizes reveal more edge cases where QAOA struggles to find valid solutions.

2. **Improving Solution Quality**: The higher path match rate (80% → 88%) and improved approximation ratio (0.9376 → 0.9493) in the larger experiment suggest that our implementation becomes more reliable with additional runs.

3. **Performance Consistency**: The consistent median approximation ratio of 1.0000 across both experiments confirms that QAOA frequently finds truly optimal solutions.

4. **Widening Performance Gap**: The increased speedup factor indicates that the classical algorithm maintains its significant speed advantage regardless of the number of runs.

### 3.6 Limitations and Opportunities for Improvement

Based on our experimental results, we can identify several limitations and potential improvements:

#### 3.6.1 Current Limitations

1. **High Fallback Rate**: The need to fall back to classical algorithms in 55-60% of cases indicates that our QAOA implementation struggles to consistently produce valid solutions for constrained path problems.

2. **Computational Overhead**: The significant speed disadvantage (by a factor of millions) makes the current QAOA implementation impractical for time-critical applications on classical hardware.

3. **Parameter Optimization Challenges**: The relatively low rate of clean QAOA success (8-15%) suggests difficulties in finding optimal parameters within the allocated optimization iterations.

4. **Fixed Graph Size**: Our experiments focused on 10-node graphs, limiting our ability to analyze how the algorithm scales with problem size.

#### 3.6.2 Improvement Opportunities

1. **Enhanced Parameter Initialization**: Implementing more sophisticated parameter initialization strategies based on graph properties could improve convergence and solution quality.

2. **Constraint Enforcement**: Exploring different penalty term formulations or alternative QUBO encodings might increase the likelihood of obtaining valid solutions directly from QAOA.

3. **Adaptive Optimization**: Implementing adaptive parameter optimization strategies that adjust based on intermediate results could improve convergence speed and solution quality.

4. **Problem-Specific Circuit Design**: Tailoring the QAOA circuit structure specifically for path problems might improve the algorithm's ability to find valid solutions.

5. **Scaling Analysis**: Expanding experiments to include various graph sizes would provide insights into how QAOA performance scales with problem complexity.

These improvement opportunities align with our proposed enhancements in Section 6, particularly the advanced parameter initialization and dynamic recalculation approaches.

### 3.7 QAOA Performance in the Heist Narrative Context

From a narrative perspective, the experimental results tell an interesting story about our quantum bank heist:

1. **Successful Escapes**: In 100% of heist attempts, the criminals successfully reached the safehouse, either through quantum-optimized routes (40-45% with clean or repaired QAOA solutions) or by falling back to classical route planning (55-60%).

2. **Optimal Getaways**: In 88% of cases (50-run experiment), the criminals found truly optimal escape routes, minimizing their risk exposure during the getaway.

3. **Route Quality**: With an average approximation ratio of ~0.95, even non-optimal quantum routes were very close to optimal, representing only a 5% increase in risk compared to the absolute best possible path.

4. **Quantum Advantage Narrative**: The apparent performance disadvantage of QAOA in terms of speed actually fits our narrative well—quantum route planning might take longer but could potentially find routes that classical algorithms miss in more complex scenarios beyond what was tested.

This narrative framing helps contextualize the technical results within the creative bank heist scenario, illustrating how the criminals' quantum advantage manifests primarily in solution quality rather than planning speed.

## 5. Implementation Restrictions and Challenges

### 5.1 Flow Conservation Constraints

The implementation enforces physical realism through flow conservation constraints:
- **Source Node Constraint**: The bank must have one more outgoing than incoming path
- **Target Node Constraint**: The safehouse must have one more incoming than outgoing path
- **Transit Node Constraint**: All intermediate locations must have equal incoming and outgoing paths

These constraints ensure that the solution represents a physically possible path through the city.

### 5.2 Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach

The solution employs a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both quantum and classical computation:
- **Quantum Circuit**: Used for exploring the solution space and generating candidate paths
- **Classical Optimization**: Used for tuning QAOA parameters to improve solution quality
- **Classical Validation**: Used for verifying and repairing quantum solutions
- **Classical Fallback**: Provides robustness when quantum approaches fail

### 5.3 Implementation Challenges

Several technical challenges were addressed in the implementation:
- **QUBO Formulation Complexity**: Translating path constraints into a QUBO format required careful mathematical modeling
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: QAOA performance is highly dependent on parameter initialization and optimization
- **Solution Interpretation**: Mapping quantum measurements to valid paths required sophisticated post-processing
- **Simulation Limitations**: Quantum simulation restricted the size and complexity of manageable city graphs

## 6. Advanced Implementation Considerations and Future Work

### 6.1 Dynamic Environment and Adaptive Path Planning

One of the most significant enhancements to the current implementation would be incorporating real-time adaptability to changing environmental conditions. In a realistic escape scenario, police forces would dynamically respond to the criminals' movements, altering the risk landscape with each step taken.

#### 6.1.1 Dynamic Weight Recalculation

The current implementation uses static weights for edges, representing an initial assessment of route difficulties. A more sophisticated approach would implement dynamically updated weights after each move, recalculating the risk landscape based on:
- Current criminal position
- Updated police positions (which could follow predefined patrol routes or react to the criminal's last known position)
- Time elapsed since the heist began (as police response intensifies over time)

#### 6.1.2 Incremental Path Recalculation

With dynamic weights, the optimal path would need to be recalculated after each move.

#### 6.1.3 Computational Efficiency Considerations

This dynamic approach would introduce significant computational challenges:

1. **Real-time Constraints**: Each QAOA recalculation must complete quickly enough to simulate real-time decision-making
2. **Diminishing Path Lengths**: As the criminal approaches the safehouse, the problem size decreases
3. **Quantum Resource Allocation**: More quantum resources might be allocated to critical decision points

A potential optimization would be implementing a "horizon" approach, calculating optimal path considering only a limited number of future moves. This horizon-based approach would significantly reduce computational load while maintaining adaptation to local environmental changes.


### 6.2 Implementation of Police Response AI

The simulation could be enhanced by implementing an adversarial AI system that models police behavior. This police response system would create a truly dynamic challenge, forcing the quantum algorithm to continuously adapt to changing conditions.

### 6.3 Summary of Achievements

The Quantum Bank Heist Simulation successfully demonstrates:
1. The application of QAOA to a practical shortest path problem in a creative context
2. A complete implementation from problem formulation to solution visualization
3. Robust handling of quantum solution validation and repair
4. Comparative analysis of quantum vs. classical approaches
5. An engaging narrative framework that makes quantum computing concepts accessible

### 6.4 Technical Implementation Improvements

Beyond the dynamic environment enhancements described above, several other technical improvements could elevate the quantum bank heist simulation:

#### 6.4.1 Advanced QAOA Parameter Initialization

Our current implementation uses a linear spacing strategy for initial QAOA parameters. More sophisticated initialization strategies could significantly improve performance. This approach would tailor the QAOA parameters to the specific characteristics of the graph, potentially reducing the number of optimization iterations required.

#### 6.4.2 Quantum Circuit Depth Optimization

For large city graphs, circuit depth becomes a limiting factor. Implementing circuit compilation optimizations could improve performance.

#### 6.4.3 Noise-Aware QAOA

Implementing noise-aware variants of QAOA would prepare the solution for eventual deployment on real quantum hardware.


### 6.5 Future Enhancements

Beyond the technical implementations detailed above, several broader enhancements could further develop the quantum bank heist concept:

- **Larger Scale Simulations**: Testing with city graphs of 50+ nodes to identify quantum advantage thresholds
- **Multi-Agent Scenarios**: Implementing multiple bank robbers with coordinated escape plans
- **Terrain Features**: Adding geographical elements that affect movement capabilities
- **Time-Dependent Risks**: Implementing changing traffic patterns or police shift changes
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balancing multiple factors like risk, time, and distance
- **Quantum Hardware Deployment**: Testing the algorithm on actual quantum computers through cloud services
- **Comparative Algorithm Analysis**: Benchmarking against other quantum algorithms like quantum walks or VQE

### 6.3 Broader Implications

## 7. Development Process and Implementation Journey

### 7.1 Iterative Development Approach

The quantum bank heist simulation wasn't built in a single step but rather evolved through an iterative development process. We maintained a structured development folder ("dev") containing various iterations and experimental implementations that led to the final solution.

### 7.2 Development Artifacts

The "dev" folder contains a collection of files documenting the evolution of our approach:

- Early prototypes focusing on basic QAOA implementation

These development artifacts provide insight into the experimental nature of quantum algorithm implementation, showing how we progressively refined our approach based on empirical testing and theoretical refinements.

### 7.3 From Concept to Implementation

The final solution represents the culmination of multiple development cycles:

1. We began with basic QUBO formulations that often produced invalid paths
2. Implemented increasingly sophisticated constraint handling
3. Developed and refined the repair mechanisms after observing high invalid solution rates
4. Added classical fallback safeguards to ensure solution reliability
5. Integrated comprehensive visualization tools for result interpretation
6. Created testing frameworks to systematically evaluate performance

This iterative approach was essential for addressing the challenges of quantum algorithm implementation, particularly for constrained optimization problems like shortest path finding. The development artifacts preserve this journey.
